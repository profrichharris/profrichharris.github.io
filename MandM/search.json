As stated here, “a project is simply a working directory designated with a .RProj file. When you open a project (using File/Open Project in RStudio or by double–clicking on the .Rproj file outside of R), the working directory will automatically be set to the directory that the .RProj file is located in.” However, it is that which makes it useful: when you open a project you know that you are going to be working in a specific folder on your computer which them becomes the default ‘container’ to save files to or to download them from.”\n\nIt would be a good idea to create a new project now which can then be the folder and working directory for this course and its contents."

It also forms part of the MSc Geographic Data Science and Spatial Analytics in the School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol.\nThe aims of this course are to teach an introduction to mapping, spatial analysis in R. It is a course in geographic data science with a particular focus on mapping, measuring and modelling spatial patterns in data. The core parts of the course are:\n\nWhy use R for mapping and spatial modelling?\nThe basics of mapping in R\nThe Spatial Variable: from maps towards models\nSpatial clustering and spatial heterogeneity: measuring patterns in data\nHarnessing spatial autocorrelation with geographically weighted statistics\nSpatial regression models\n\n\nThis is a work in progress\nChanges will be made and additional content added over time so check back here for the latest updates."
