## About the course

The contents of this course were first developed for a short course at the [University of Cape Town (UCT)](https://www.uct.ac.za/){target="_blank"} in August 2022. It also forms part of the [MSc Geographic Data Science and Spatial Analytics](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/2023/sci/msc-geographic-data-science-and-spatial-analytics/) in the [School of Geographical Sciences](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/){target="_blank"}, [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/){target="_blank"}.

The aims of this course are to teach an introduction to mapping, spatial analysis in R. It is a course in geographic data science with a particular focus on mapping, measuring and modelling spatial patterns in data. The core parts of the course are:

-   Why use R for mapping and spatial modelling?
-   The basics of mapping in R
-   The Spatial Variable: from maps towards models
-   Spatial clustering and spatial heterogeneity: measuring patterns in data
-   Harnessing spatial autocorrelation with geographically weighted statistics
-   Spatial regression models

Changes will be made and additional content added over time so check back here for the latest updates.

## Course text

The most relevant texts for this course are:

First, parts II (Chapters 7 to 9) and III (Chapters 10 to 17) of [Spatial Data Science with Applications in R](https://www.routledge.com/Spatial-Data-Science-With-Applications-in-R/Pebesma-Bivand/p/book/9781138311183){target="_blank"}. An online version of the book is available [here](https://r-spatial.org/book/){target="_blank"}. It takes a deeper dive into the fundamentals of spatial data science than this course does and is more 'technical' but is a good resource to extend your knowledge of geographical/spatial data science.

Second, Chapters 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 of of [Spatial Data Science with Applications in R](https://www.routledge.com/Spatial-Statistics-for-Data-Science-Theory-and-Practice-with-R/Moraga/p/book/9781032633510){target="_blank"}. An online version of the book is available [here](https://www.paulamoraga.com/book-spatial/index.html){target="_blank"}.

## Pre-reading

**The following short pre-reading is recommended for the course:**

Harris RJ (2019). Not just nuisance: spatialising social statistics. In A Whitworth (ed.) Towards a Spatial Social Policy: Bridging the Gap Between Geography and Social Policy. Chapter 8. Bristol: Policy Press. [Available here](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/admin/files/218309996/Harris_chapter_revised.pdf){target="_blank"} (or, if that doesn't work [try here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s8iumcgcnkjm1fx/Harris_chapter_revised.pdf?dl=1){target="_blank"}).

## Other useful resources

[Spatial Regression Models for the Social Sciences](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/spatial-regression-models-for-the-social-sciences/book258546) covers similar statistical ground to this course, For University of Bristol students, it is available to view as an eBook [here](https://bris.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1106114802){target="_blank"}.

In addition, [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/index.html){target="_blank"} by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nawosad & Jannes Muenchow offers an extremely useful reference to have to hand if you are stuck when undertaking geocomputation with R. There is a [free online version](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/index.html){target="_blank"} available.
