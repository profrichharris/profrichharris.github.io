R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. To run the code blocks for this course on your own computer you will need to have [installed R](https://cran.r-project.org/){target=\"_blank\"}. This is available for Linux, MacOS and Windows.\n\n![](hazard.gif){width=\"75\"}\n\n<font size = 3>**IMPORTANT: Mac users, make sure you have installed the right version of R for your laptop's processor (M1/M2 or Intel)**</font>\n\nAt the time of publishing, I am using `r R.Version()$version`.\n\n## Install R Studio\n\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that can make programming and other tasks easier in R. [An open source edition](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/){target=\"_blank\"} is available to download and install.\n\n![](hazard.gif){width=\"75\"}\n\n<font size = 3>You need to install R before you install R Studio.</font>\n\n## Open R Studio\n\nOnce R and R Studio are installed, open R Studio on your computer and type the following in the Console to the left or bottom left of the screen, alongside the prompt, `>`.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\n#| eval: false\n1 + 1\n```\n\nthen hit `Enter`/`Return`. You should, of course, obtain the answer 2, as below.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| eval: true\n1 + 1\n```\n\nYou will also find that if you move your mouse to over the code block above, an option appears to copy the code to the clipboard, allowing you to then paste it into the R Console window in R Studio.\n\n![](copy.png)\n\n## Install additional libraries/packages\n\nThe base functions of R are greatly extended by the very many packages/libraries that have been developed for it. At the time of writing, there are `r available.packages(repos = \"https://cran.r-project.org\", filters = c(\"CRAN\", \"duplicates\")) |> nrow()` of these on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html){target=\"_blank\"}, which is the main repository for them. Many of these have been grouped into 'tasks' and topic areas, which can be viewed [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nMost of the packages that will be needed for this course will be installed as they are needed. However, some will be used so regularly that we should install them now. Cut and paste the following code chunk into the Console and hit Enter/Return.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\ninstall.packages(\"proxy\", dependencies = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"sf\", dependencies = TRUE)\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\", dependencies = TRUE)\n```\n\n![](hazard.gif){width=\"75\"}\n\n<font size = 3>Run the code above even if you have the packages installed already so that you also have available all the packages that these depend upon and link to.</font>\n\n## Changing the working directory\n\nIf you type `getwd()` into the R Console you will obtain your current working directory -- the default location to look for files and to save content to. Mine is,\n\n```{r}\ngetwd()\n```\n\nYou may wish to change this to something else each time you start R. You can do this using the drop-down menus. There is also the function `setwd(dir)` -- type `?setwd` in the R Console to learn more.\n\n![](change_dir.png)\n\n## Organising your files in a project\n\nRather than having to set your working directory each time you restart R, you could also create a new project in R by using File --\\> New Project... from the dropdown menus and create it either in a new directory (probably most sensible) or an existing one.\n\nThere is nothing especially magical about a project in R. As stated [here](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/projects-in-rstudio.html){target=\"_blank\"}, \"a project is simply a working directory designated with a .RProj file. When you open a project (using File/Open Project in RStudio or by double--clicking on the .Rproj file outside of R), the working directory will automatically be set to the directory that the .RProj file is located in.\" However, it is that which makes it useful: when you open a project you know that you are going to be working in a specific folder on your computer which them becomes the default 'container' to save files to or to download them from.\"\n\n![](hazard.gif){width=\"75\"}\n\n<font size = 3>**It would be a good idea to create a new project now which can then be the folder and working directory for this course and its contents.**</font>\n\n## Changing the appearance of R Studio\n\nYou may notice that I prefer a blue to a white screen when working in R. To change it to this, from the drop-down menus use Tools --\\> Global Options... -\\> Appearance, and select Solarized Dark as the Editor theme. You may, of course, have your own preference.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\ninstalled <- installed.packages()[,1]\npkgs <- c(\"XML\", \"tidyverse\", \"sf\")\ninstall <- pkgs[!(pkgs %in% installed)]\nif(length(install)) install.packages(install, dependencies = TRUE, repos = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\")\n```\n\n## Install R\n\nFor this course we will be using R.
