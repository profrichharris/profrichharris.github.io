This is because the values that the colours represent vary across the country with some places having a greater percentage of their population without schooling than others. In this way, the map reveals and also visually represents the spatial (geographic) variation in the variable of interest. The map portrays the geographic pattern. Knowing something about the pattern might provide information about the processes that generated the pattern. At a minimum, it can reveal socio-spatial inequalities in an outcome of interest across a study region. \n\n![](noschool.jpg)\n\nIt is not surprising to find spatial variation. It is improbable that all the values would be the same. It is nearly always possible to find that some places have lower or higher values than others and to colour the map accordingly. Nevertheless, three characteristics of the spatial variation appear evident in the map.\n\n1. **Spatial heterogeneity**.

This is the idea that values found in one part of the map tend to be surrounded by similar values in neighbouring parts of the map.

Another name for this is **positive spatial autocorrelation**: values tend to be more similar to nearby other values than they are to distant ones.\n\nEvidence of spatial clustering supports Waldo Tobler's much cited 'first law' of geography: *\"everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\"* However, it isn't really a law because it is by no means always true.
