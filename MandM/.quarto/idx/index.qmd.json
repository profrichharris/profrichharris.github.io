It also forms part of the [MSc Geographic Data Science and Spatial Analytics](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/2023/sci/msc-geographic-data-science-and-spatial-analytics/) in the [School of Geographical Sciences](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/){target=\"_blank\"}, [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nThe aims of this course are to teach an introduction to mapping, spatial analysis in R. It is a course in geographic data science with a particular focus on mapping, measuring and modelling spatial patterns in data. The core parts of the course are:\n\n-   Why use R for mapping and spatial modelling?\n-   The basics of mapping in R\n-   The Spatial Variable: from maps towards models\n-   Spatial clustering and spatial heterogeneity: measuring patterns in data\n-   Harnessing spatial autocorrelation with geographically weighted statistics\n-   Spatial regression models\n\n![](at_work.gif){width=\"75\"}\n\n**This is a work in progress**\n\nChanges will be made and additional content added over time so check back here for the latest updates.\n\n## Course text\n\nThe most relevant texts for this course are:\n\nFirst, parts II (Chapters 7 to 9) and III (Chapters 10 to 17) of [Spatial Data Science with Applications in R](https://www.routledge.com/Spatial-Data-Science-With-Applications-in-R/Pebesma-Bivand/p/book/9781138311183){target=\"_blank\"}. An online version of the book is available [here](https://r-spatial.org/book/){target=\"_blank\"}. It takes a deeper dive into the fundamentals of spatial data science than this course does and is more 'technical' but is a good resource to extend your knowledge of geographical/spatial data science.\n\n![](spatial_data_science.jpg){width=\"100\"}\n\nSecond, Chapters 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 of of [Spatial Data Science with Applications in R](https://www.routledge.com/Spatial-Statistics-for-Data-Science-Theory-and-Practice-with-R/Moraga/p/book/9781032633510){target=\"_blank\"}.
