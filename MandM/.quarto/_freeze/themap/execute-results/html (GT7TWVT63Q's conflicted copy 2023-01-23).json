This is because the values that the colours represent vary across the country with some places having a greater percentage of their population without schooling than others. In this way, the map reveals and also visually represents the spatial (geographic) variation in the variable of interest. The map portrays the geographic pattern.\n\n![](noschool.jpg)\n\nIt is not surprising to find variation. It is improbable that all the values would be the same. It is nearly always possible to find that some places have lower or higher values than others and to colour the map accordingly. Nevertheless, two characteristics of the spatial variation appear evident in the map.\n\n1. **Spatial heterogeneity**. This is the idea that the values typical in one part of the map are not typical in another. To put it simply, some parts of the map are shaded in blue whereas others are in red and those parts seem neither randomly nor regularly distributed because of...\n\n2. **Spatial clustering**. This is the idea that values found in one part of the map tend to be surrounded by similar values in neighbouring parts of the map. In other words, there are patches of blue and patches of red coloured areas on the map -- blue tends be near blue and red tends to be near red Another name for this is **positive spatial autocorrelation**: values tend to be more similar to nearby other values than they are to distant ones.\n\nEvidence of spatial clustering supports Waldo Tobler's much cited 'first law' of geography: *\"everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\"* It isn't really a law because it is by no means always true: sometimes neighbouring places can have very different characteristics (there can be sharp changes across borders; spatial discontinuities). However, it does suggest that places tend to be situated within broader **spatial contexts** such that the processes that both generate and are generated by those contexts have a spatial expression and root. They map may reveal evidence of historic and on-going processes of socio-spatial inequalities, for example. \n\nTaken together, these characteristics of spatial variation indicate **spatial dependencies**, whereby the measured attributes of one place *are not independent* of other places. This dependence has statistical consequences if assumptions of independence are violated. Of more substantive geographic interest is how they have arisen -- which processes are they caused by or associated with? Why are places not all the same? Why is there a geographical pattern?\n\n## From the map towards models\n\nWith the above questions in mind, we might imagine the map as a first stage in a process of geographical enquiry where what we do is look for and then quantify some of the geographical patterns in the data before beginning to model them. Here the map is not simply a tool for visualising and communicating data, it is also a tool for exploring data and thinking geographically about them.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-b8d0aa6072583c105e65\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\" class=\"grViz html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-b8d0aa6072583c105e65\">{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ndigraph boxes_and_circles {\\n      \\n      # a \\\"graph\\\" statement\\n      graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10, rankdir = TB]\\n      \\n      # several \\\"node\\\" statements\\n      \\n      node [fontname = Helvetica, style = filled, fillcolor = white]\\n      A [label = \\\"Map\\\", fillcolor = orange]\\n      1 [label = \\\"Measure\\\"]\\n      I [label = \\\"Model\\\"]\\n      \\n      # several \\\"edge\\\" statements\\n      A->1->I\\n      }\\n\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</br>\nIn practice, the process of analysis is likely to involve greater cycling between the various stages. Nevertheless, there is a good argument for starting with the map.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-99e6bf9204f4e60d3e0b\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\" class=\"grViz html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-99e6bf9204f4e60d3e0b\">{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ndigraph boxes_and_circles {\\n      \\n      # a \\\"graph\\\" statement\\n      graph [overlap = true, fontsize = 10, rankdir = TB]\\n      \\n      # several \\\"node\\\" statements\\n      \\n      node [fontname = Helvetica, style = filled, fillcolor = white]\\n      A [label = \\\"Map\\\", fillcolor = orange]\\n      1 [label = \\\"Measure\\\"]\\n      I [label = \\\"Model\\\"]\\n      \\n      # several \\\"edge\\\" statements\\n      A->1->I\\n      1->A\\n      I->1\\n      I->A\\n      A->I\\n      }\\n\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Further Reading\n\nThe Spatial Variable was the name of a lecture given by Ron Johnson, one of the most influential geographers of recent times, on his appointment as Professor at the University of Sheffield. A transcript and brief commentary on that lecture [is available here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epub/10.1080/14702541.2022.2089722?needAccess=true){target=\"_blank\"} and is highly recommended reading.\n\n\n",
