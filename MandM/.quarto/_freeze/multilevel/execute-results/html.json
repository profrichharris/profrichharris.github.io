That continuous view of space is clear if we fit a simple 'null model' of the COVID-19 rates in London in the week before Christmas 2021 and map the results. It is a null model because it includes no predictor variables other than the local estimate of the intercept (i.e. the local mean rate of COVID-19). What is clear is how that local estimate is allowed to vary across geographic space.\n\n(Download and extract the data for London and fit the GWR model)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrequire(sf)\nrequire(ggplot2)\nrequire(tidyverse)\nrequire(GWmodel)\n\nif(!file.exists(\"covid_xmas_2021.geojson\")) download.file(\"https://github.com/profrichharris/profrichharris.github.io/raw/main/MandM/data/covid_xmas_2021.geojson\", \"covid_xmas_2021.geojson\", mode = \"wb\", quiet = TRUE)\nxmas_covid <- read_sf(\"covid_xmas_2021.geojson\")\n\nxmas_covid %>% \n  filter(regionName == \"London\") ->\n  ldn_covid\n\nldn_covid_sp <- as_Spatial(ldn_covid)\nbw <- bw.gwr(rate ~ 1, data = ldn_covid_sp, adaptive = TRUE)\ngwrmod <- gwr.basic(rate ~ 1, data = ldn_covid_sp, bw = bw, adaptive = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n(Map the predicted COVID-19 rates across London based on the spatially varying local mean estimate)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nldn_covid$yhat <- gwrmod$SDF$yhat\nggplot(data = ldn_covid, aes(fill = yhat)) +\n  geom_sf(size = 0.25) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(\"Modelled rate\", palette = \"YlOrRd\", direction = 1, limits = c(1.2,3)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](multilevel_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMultilevel models, by contrast, have more of a discrete view of space because observations at some base level are treated as members of a group at a second, more aggregate level. In a geographic context, the base level could be neighbourhoods and the groups could be the local authorities to which the neighbourhoods belong. This more discrete view of space becomes clear if we fit a very simple (too simple, really) null model of the COVID-19 rates in London, using the local authority estimates from this multilevel model as the nearest equivalent to the local means of the GWR model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrequire(lme4)\nmlm <- lmer(rate ~ (1|LtlaName), data = ldn_covid)\nldn_covid$yhat <- predict(mlm, re.form = ~ (1|LtlaName))\nggplot(data = ldn_covid, aes(fill = yhat)) +\n  geom_sf(size = 0.25) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(\"Modelled rate\", palette = \"YlOrRd\", direction = 1, limits = c(1.2,3)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](multilevel_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we compare the map above with that produced from the GWR estimates then we find that there are commonalities in the two maps but the multilevel model clearly has the more bounded view of geographic space.\n\n## Multilevel models\n\nThe package that we are using to fit the models here is [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html){target=\"_blank\"}. The formula `rate ~ (1|LtlaName)` means that we are modelling the COVID-19 `rate` against a random intercept that varies by local authority (by local authority name, `LtlaName`). It is not the only way of fitting multilevel models in R (an alternative, for example, is [brms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_multilevel.pdf){target=\"_blank\"}) but it is sufficient for the purposes of this exercise.\n\nThe more discrete and bounded view of geographic space that the multilevel model (in its simplest form, at least) employs seems quite restricting -- in this case study it is suggesting that the causes of COVID-19 are somehow related to 'things' that happen or have consequences at a local authority scale. The implication is that the boundaries of local authorities are relevant to the geographical causes and rates of COVID-19. This is not an assumption that GWR makes so why use multilevel models instead?\n\nOne answer is that a multilevel model is often faster to fit. Consider the following example, which extends the study region to London and the South East.\n\n(Fit the GWR model and the multilevel model)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxmas_covid %>%\n  filter(regionName == \"London\" | regionName == \"South East\") ->\n  ldn_se_covid\nldn_se_covid_sp <- as_Spatial(ldn_se_covid)\nt1 <- Sys.time()\nbw <- bw.gwr(rate ~ 1, data = ldn_se_covid_sp, adaptive = TRUE)\ngwrmod <- gwr.basic(rate ~ 1, data = ldn_se_covid_sp, bw = bw, adaptive = TRUE)\ngwrt <- Sys.time() - t1\nt2 <- Sys.time()\nmlm <- lmer(rate ~ (1|LtlaName), data = ldn_se_covid)\nmlmt <- Sys.time() - t2\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe computation times are,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngwrt\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTime difference of 7.035109 secs\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmlmt\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTime difference of 0.06526804 secs\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAdmittedly, neither took very long to fit, with the GWR taking 0.12 minutes and the multilevel model (MLM) taking 0.07 seconds on my laptop. However, these differences become more noticeable with more complex models or larger study regions. The multilevel model is estimating far fewer model parameters than the GWR. This is because the GWR is really lots of models that are fitted separately (one for each location) and then compared, whereas the multilevel model is one model but one which allows for variance at the geographic level(s) of the model, so better local authorities, for example. Put another way, the GWR is a series of local models that are compared, whereas the multilevel model is a global model that allows for local variations around it: at the moment, all it is doing is estimating the average COVID rate for the whole study region but also recognising that different local authorities have rates that vary around the overall average.\n\nSecond, multilevel models can be used -- as their name suggests! -- to fit multi-level models to examine the scale of the geographic pattern of a variable. Consider the following example, which fits a multilevel model to the COVID-19 rates of all English neighbourhoods in the week before Christmas 2021. There are now three levels in the model, which are the base neighbourhoods level, then the local authorities in which the neighourhoods are located, and then the English regions to which the local authorities belong. Hence, three levels and three simultaneous scales of analysis: neighbourhoods, local authorities and regions. Although the resulting map suffers a little from the 'invisibility problem' of some small areas within it, the higher COVID-19 rate in parts of London and the South East is evident (but not solely confined to these regions, as there is also a high rate evident in the North West).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmlm <- lmer(rate ~ (1|LtlaName) + (1|regionName), data = xmas_covid)\nxmas_covid$yhat <- predict(mlm, re.form = ~ (1|LtlaName) + (1|regionName))\nggplot(data = xmas_covid, aes(fill = yhat)) +\n  geom_sf(col = NA) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(\"Modelled rate\", palette = \"YlOrRd\", direction = 1) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](multilevel_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHaving fitted a model with three geographic levels, the geographical question that we can now ask is which of the levels of the model contributes most to the geographical patterning of the disease. Do we get most variation between neighbourhoods (suggesting the geographic pattern is mostly at the neighbourhood level), between local authorities (so a local authority patterning) or between regions (evidence of strongest regional differences)? We can answer the question by looking at how much of the variance belongs to each level, which we can see in the summary under Random effects.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(mlm)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: rate ~ (1 | LtlaName) + (1 | regionName)\n   Data: xmas_covid\n\nREML criterion at convergence: 2858.8\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-5.3127 -0.6222 -0.0334  0.5832  6.8771 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups     Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n LtlaName   (Intercept) 0.08043  0.2836  \n regionName (Intercept) 0.14923  0.3863  \n Residual               0.07714  0.2777  \nNumber of obs: 6789, groups:  LtlaName, 315; regionName, 9\n\nFixed effects:\n            Estimate Std.
