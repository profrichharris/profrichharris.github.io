It consists of [a collection of R packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/){target=\"_blank\"} that \"share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures\".\n\nTidyverse is easier to demonstrate then to pin-down to some basics so let's work through an example using both base R and tidyverse to illustrate some differences.\n\n## To Start\n\nWe will begin by downloading a data file to use. It is an extract of the [Covid Data Dashboard](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/){target=\"_blank\"} for England in December 2021. Some prior manipulation and adjustments to these data have been undertaken for another project so treat them as indicative only (the actual numbers may have been changed slightly from their originals although only marginally so).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndownload.file(\"https://github.com/profrichharris/profrichharris.github.io/raw/main/MandM/data/covid_extract.csv\", \"covid.csv\", mode = \"wb\", quiet = TRUE) \n```\n:::\n\n\nWe also need to `require(tidyverse)` ready for use.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrequire(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](hazard.gif){width=75}\n\n<font size = 3>If you get a warning message saying there is no package called tidyverse then you need to install it: `install.packages(\"tidyverse\", dependencies = TRUE)`.</font>\n\n## Reading-in the data\n\nLet's read-in and take a look at the data. First in base R.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf1 <- read.csv(\"covid.csv\")\nhead(df1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n   MSOA11CD regionName X2021.12.04 X2021.12.11 X2021.12.18 X2021.12.25 All.Ages\n1 E02000002     London          25          48         148         176     7726\n2 E02000003     London          46          58         165         215    11246\n3 E02000004     London          24          44         100         141     6646\n4 E02000005     London          58          97         185         231    10540\n5 E02000007     London          38          94         153         205    10076\n6 E02000008     London          54         101         232         245    12777\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow using tidyverse,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf2 <- read_csv(\"covid.csv\")\nprint(df2, n = 6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6,789 × 7\n  MSOA11CD  regionName `2021-12-04` `2021-12-11` `2021-12-18` `2021-12-25`\n  <chr>     <chr>             <dbl>        <dbl>        <dbl>        <dbl>\n1 E02000002 London               25           48          148          176\n2 E02000003 London               46           58          165          215\n3 E02000004 London               24           44          100          141\n4 E02000005 London               58           97          185          231\n5 E02000007 London               38           94          153          205\n6 E02000008 London               54          101          232          245\n# … with 6,783 more rows, and 1 more variable: `All Ages` <dbl>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are already some differences. First, tidyverse has, in this case, handled the names of the variables better. It has also created what is described as a `tibble` which is \"a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not.\" You can find out more about them and how they differ from traditional data frames [here](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n## Selecting and renaming variables\n\nWe will now select the `regionName`, `2021-12-04` and `All Ages` variables, rename the second of these as `cases` and the third as `population`, and look at the data again to check that it has worked.\n\nIn base R,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf1 <- df1[, c(\"regionName\", \"X2021.12.04\", \"All.Ages\")]\nnames(df1)[2:3] <- c(\"cases\", \"population\")\nhead(df1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  regionName cases population\n1     London    25       7726\n2     London    46      11246\n3     London    24       6646\n4     London    58      10540\n5     London    38      10076\n6     London    54      12777\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn tidyverse,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf2 <- select(df2, regionName, `2021-12-04`, `All Ages`)\ndf2 <- rename(df2, cases = `2021-12-04`, population = `All Ages`)\nprint(df2, n = 6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6,789 × 3\n  regionName cases population\n  <chr>      <dbl>      <dbl>\n1 London        25       7726\n2 London        46      11246\n3 London        24       6646\n4 London        58      10540\n5 London        38      10076\n6 London        54      12777\n# … with 6,783 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nComparing the two, the tidyverse code may be more intuitive to understand because of its use of verbs as functions: `select()`, `rename()` and so forth.\n\n## Piping\n\nNow we shall bring the two previous stages together, using what is referred to as a pipe. Without worrying about the detail, which will be returned to presently, here is an example of a pipe, `|>`, being used in base R:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nread.csv(\"covid.csv\") |>\n  (\\(x) x[, c(\"regionName\", \"X2021.12.04\", \"All.Ages\")])() -> df1\nnames(df1)[2:3] <- c(\"cases\", \"population\")\ndf1 |>\n  head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  regionName cases population\n1     London    25       7726\n2     London    46      11246\n3     London    24       6646\n4     London    58      10540\n5     London    38      10076\n6     London    54      12777\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![](hazard.gif){width=75}\n\n<font size = 3>The above will only work if you are using R version 4.1.0 or above. You can check which version you are running by using `R.Version()$version`.</font>\n\nNow using tidyverse and a different pipe, `%>%`,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nread_csv(\"covid.csv\") %>%\n  select(regionName, `2021-12-04`, `All Ages`) %>%\n  rename(cases = `2021-12-04`, population = `All Ages`) %>%\n  print(n = 6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6,789 × 3\n  regionName cases population\n  <chr>      <dbl>      <dbl>\n1 London        25       7726\n2 London        46      11246\n3 London        24       6646\n4 London        58      10540\n5 London        38      10076\n6 London        54      12777\n# … with 6,783 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe obvious difference here is that the tidyverse code is more elegant. But what is the pipe and what is the difference between `|>` in the base R code and `%>%` in the tidyverse example?\n\nA pipe is really just a way of sending ('piping`) something from one line of code to the next, to create a chain of commands (forgive the mixed metaphors). For example,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 0:10\nmean(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCould be calculated as\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n0:10 |>\n  mean()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nor as\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n0:10 %>%\n  mean\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA more complicated example is below. It employs the function `sapply()`, a variant of the function `lapply(X, FUN)` that takes a list `X` and applies the function `FUN` to each part of it. In the example, it is the function `mean`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- list(0:10, 10:20)  # Creates a list with two parts: the numbers 0 to 10, and 10 to 20\ny <- sapply(x, mean)    # Calculates the mean for each part of the list, which are 5 and 15\nsum(y)                  # Sums together the two means, giving 20\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 20\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above could instead be written as\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlist(0:10, 10:20) |>\n  sapply(mean) |>\n  sum()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 20\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nor as\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlist(0:10, 10:20) %>%\n  sapply(mean) %>%\n  sum\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 20\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAll three arrive at the same answer, which is 20.\n\nSo far, so good but what is the difference between `|>` and `%>%`? The answer is that `%>%` was developed before `|>` in the [magrittr package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/){target=\"_blank\"}, whereas `|>` is [R's new native pipe](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/05/the-new-r-pipe/){target=\"_blank\"}. They are often interchangeable **but not always**.\n\nAt the moment, the `|>` pipe is less flexible to use than `%>%`. Consider the following example. The final two lines of code work fine using `%>%` to pipe the data frame into the regression model (the function `lm()` fits a linear model).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 1:100\ny <- 2*x + rnorm(100)   # Adds some random noise to the relationship between y and x\ndata.frame(x, y) %>%\n  lm(y ~ x, data = .)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = y ~ x, data = .)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)            x  \n   -0.03212      1.99702  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHowever, it does *not* work with the pipe, `|>` because it does not recognise the place holder `.`, which receives the data frame from the line above and contains the variables for the model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The following code does not work\nx <- 1:100\ny <- 2*x + rnorm(100)\ndata.frame(x, y) |>\n  lm(y ~ x, data = .)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo solve the problem, the above code can be modified by wrapping the regression part in another function but the end result is rather 'clunky'.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 1:100\ny <- 2*x + rnorm(100)\ndata.frame(x, y) |>\n  (\\(z) lm(y ~ x, data = z))() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = y ~ x, data = z)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)            x  \n     0.3335       1.9951  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOver time, expect `|>` to be developed and to supersede `%>%`. For now, however, you are unlikely to encounter errors using `%>%` as a substitute for `|>` but you might using `|>` instead of `%>%`. In other words, `%>%` is the safer choice and the one which will be used for these tutorials.\n\n## Back to the example\n\nAfter that digression into piping, let's return to our example that is comparing base R and tidyverse to read-in a table of data, select variables and rename one, and, in the following, to calculate the number of COVID-19 cases per English region as a percentage of their estimated populations in the week ending 2021-12-04.\n\nFirst, in base R:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf1 <- read.csv(\"covid.csv\")\ndf1 <- df1[, c(\"regionName\", \"X2021.12.04\", \"All.Ages\")]\nnames(df1)[c(2,3)] <- c(\"cases\", \"population\")\ncases <- tapply(df1$cases, df1$regionName, sum)  # Total cases per region\ncases    # This step isn't necessary but is included to show the result of the line above\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           East Midlands          East of England                   London \n                   25472                    35785                    43060 \n              North East               North West               South East \n                   10796                    31185                    62807 \n              South West            West Midlands Yorkshire and The Humber \n                   33846                    26554                    21079 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npopulation <- tapply(df1$population, df1$regionName, sum)   # Total population per region\nrate <- round(cases / population * 100, 3)\nrate\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           East Midlands          East of England                   London \n                   0.524                    0.571                    0.479 \n              North East               North West               South East \n                   0.403                    0.423                    0.681 \n              South West            West Midlands Yorkshire and The Humber \n                   0.598                    0.445                    0.381 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow using tidyverse,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nread_csv(\"covid.csv\") %>%\n  select(regionName, `2021-12-04`, `All Ages`) %>%\n  rename(cases = `2021-12-04`, population = `All Ages`) %>%\n  group_by(regionName) %>%\n  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), sum)) %>%\n  mutate(rate = round(cases / population * 100, 3)) %>%\n  print(n = Inf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 9 × 4\n  regionName               cases population  rate\n  <chr>                    <dbl>      <dbl> <dbl>\n1 East Midlands            25472    4865583 0.524\n2 East of England          35785    6269161 0.571\n3 London                   43060    8991550 0.479\n4 North East               10796    2680763 0.403\n5 North West               31185    7367456 0.423\n6 South East               62807    9217265 0.681\n7 South West               33846    5656917 0.598\n8 West Midlands            26554    5961929 0.445\n9 Yorkshire and The Humber 21079    5526350 0.381\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEither way produces the same answers but, again, there is an elegance and consistency to the tidyverse way of doing it that is missing from base R.\n\n## Plotting\n\nAs a final step for the comparison, we will extend the code to visualise the regional COVID-19 rates in a histogram, with a rug plot included.

This is partly because there is more customisation of it to mimic the previous plot, which has added the final two lines of code. However, it is also because it is using the package [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/){target=\"_blank\"} to produce the histogram. We return to `ggplot2` more in later sessions. For now it is sufficient to scan the code and observe how it is 'layering up' the various components of the graphic, which those components separated by the `+` in the lines of code.\n\nI prefer the `ggplot2` to the `hist()` graphics plot but that may be a matter of personal taste. However, `ggplot2` can do 'clever things' with the visualisation, a hint of which is shown below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrequire(ggplot2)\ndf2 %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = rate)) +\n    geom_histogram(colour = \"black\", fill = \"grey\", binwidth = 0.05, center = -0.025) +\n    geom_rug(aes(colour = regionName), size = 2) +\n    labs(x = \"rate (cases as % of population)\", y = \"Frequency\",\n         title = \"Regional COVID-19 rates: week ending 2021-12-04\") +\n    scale_colour_discrete(name = \"Region\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n</br>\nPlease don't form that impression that `ggplot2` is hard-wired to tidverse, and base R to the base `graphics`.  In practice, they are interchangeable.\n\nHere is an example of using `ggplot2` after a sequence of base R commands.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf1 <- read.csv(\"covid.csv\")\ndf1 <- df1[, c(\"regionName\", \"X2021.12.04\", \"All.Ages\")]\nnames(df1)[c(2,3)] <- c(\"cases\", \"population\")\ndf1$rate <- round(df1$cases / df1$population * 100, 3)\nggplot(df1, aes(x = rate, y = regionName)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"rate (cases as % of population)\",\n       y = \"region\",\n       title = \"Regional COVID-19 rates: week ending 2021-12-04\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd here is an example of using the base R graphic `boxplot()` after a chain of tidyverse commands.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nread_csv(\"covid.csv\") %>%\n  select(regionName, `2021-12-04`, `All Ages`) %>%\n  rename(cases = `2021-12-04`, population = `All Ages`) %>%\n  mutate(rate = round(cases / population * 100, 3)) -> df2\npar(mai=c(0.8,2,0.5,0.5), bty = \"n\", pch = 20)  # See text below\nboxplot(df2$rate ~ df2$regionName, horizontal = TRUE,\n        whisklty = \"solid\", staplelty = 0,\n        col = \"white\", las = 1, cex = 0.9, cex.axis = 0.75,\n        xlab = \"rate (cases as % of population)\", ylab=\"\",\n        main = \"Regional COVID-19 rates: week ending 2021-12-04\")\ntitle(ylab = \"region\", line = 6)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tidyverse_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI would argue that, in this instance, the base R graphic is as nice as the ggplot2 one but it took more customisation to get it that way and I had to go digging around in the help files, `?boxplot`, `?bxp` and `?par` to find what I needed, which included changing the graphic's margins (`par(mai=...))`), moving and changing the size of the text on the vertical axis (the argument `cex.axis` and the use of the `title()` function), changing the appearance of the 'whiskers' (`whisklty = \"solid\"` and `staplelty = 0`), and so forth. Still, it does demonstrate that you can have a lot of control over what is produced, if you have the patience and tenacity to do so.\n\n## Which is better?\n\nHaving provided a very small taste of tidyverse and how it differs from base R, we might be tempted to ask, \"which is better?\" However, the question is misguided: it is a little like deciding to go to South America and asking whether Spanish or Portuguese is the better language. It depends, of course, on what you intend to do and where you intend to travel.\n\nI use both base R and tidyverse packages in my work, sometimes drifting between the two in rather haphazard ways. If I can get what I want to work then I am happy. Outcomes worry me more than means so, although I use tidyverse a lot, I am not always as tidy as it would want me to be!\n\n## Futher reading\n\n![](data_science.png){width=100}\n\nThere is **much** more to tidyverse than has been covered here. See [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/){target=\"_blank} for further information about it and its core packages.\n\nA full introduction to using tidyverse for Data Science is provided by the book R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.
