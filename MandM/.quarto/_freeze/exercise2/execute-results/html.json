The file is in .geojson format. The data are sourced from [here](https://data-communities.opendata.arcgis.com/search?q=IMD){target=\"_blank\"} and give Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) data for English local authorities.\n-    **To read the following file into R**: [https://github.com/profrichharris/profrichharris.github.io/raw/main/MandM/data/gb.csv](https://github.com/profrichharris/profrichharris.github.io/raw/main/MandM/data/gb.csv){target=\"_blank\"}. This gives the names, population size and a centroid location for 2,680 prominent cities in United Kingdom. The file is in .csv format (with a header). Read it into an object called `cities`. The data were sourced from [here](https://simplemaps.com/data/gb-cities){target=\"_blank\"}.\n-   **To run the following code**, which will convert the `cities` into spatial points:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncities <- st_as_sf(cities, coords = c(\"lng\", \"lat\"), crs = 4326)\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **To run the following code**, which will 'clip out' the cities that are not in England:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncities <- st_filter(cities, imd)\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **To draw a map** of the variable `RAvgScor`, which is the rank of the average 2019 multiple deprivation score for the authorities. Aim for the map to be of a publishable quality -- suitable for a journal publication. Include cities above a chosen population threshold on your map to provide some geographical context for the reader.\n\nThen add a very brief textual comment beneath your code and map(s) to provide a brief description of the geography of deprivation shown -- do you see any geographical pattern(s)?\n\n## To help\n\nAll that you need is in the session 'Thematic maps in R'. However, you do need to decide whether to produce your map in `ggplot2` or `tmap`. You could always impress me and use both!\n",
